                <p>Earth is our home planet. Scientists believe Earth and its moon formed around the same time as the rest of the solar system. 
				They think that was about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. Its diameter is about 8,000 miles. 
				And Earth is the third-closest planet to the sun. Its average distance from the sun is about 93 million miles. Only Mercury and Venus are closer.
                </p>
				<p>Earth has been called the "Goldilocks planet." In the story of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," a little girl named Goldilocks liked everything just right. 
				Her porridge couldn't be too hot or too cold. And her bed couldn't be too hard or too soft. On Earth, everything is just right for life to exist. 
				It's warm, but not too warm. And it has water, but not too much water.
				</p>
				<p>Earth is the only planet known to have large amounts of liquid water. Liquid water is essential for life. Earth is the only planet where life is known to exist.

                <p>The shape of Earth approximates an oblate spheroid, a sphere flattened along the axis from pole to pole such that there is a bulge around the equator. 
				This bulge results from the rotation of Earth, and causes the diameter at the equator to be 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter. 
				Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador. The average diameter of the reference spheroid is about 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), 
				which is approximately 40,000 km/π, because the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through Paris, France.</p>
				<p>Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum 
				deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10911 m below local sea level), 
				whereas Mount Everest (8,848 m above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%. 
				If Earth were shrunk to the size of a cue ball, some areas of Earth such as mountain ranges and oceanic trenches 
				would feel like small imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the Great Plains and the abyssal plains, 
				would actually feel smoother than a cue ball. Due to the equatorial bulge, the surface locations farthest from Earth's 
				center are the summits of Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador and Huascarán in Peru.</p>

                <p> Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties, 
				but unlike the other terrestrial planets, it has a distinct outer and inner core. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, 
				which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity, and the thickness 
				of the crust varies: averaging 6 km (kilometers) under the oceans and 30-50 km on the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper 
				mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is 
				the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur 
				at 410 and 660 km below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity 
				liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. The inner core may rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing 
				by 0.1–0.5° per year. The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of Earth's.

                <p> Plate tectonics is from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the Greek: τεκτονικός which means "pertaining to building". 
                    It is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motion of Earth's lithosphere. This theoretical model builds 
                    on the concept of continental drift which was developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. 
                    The geoscientific community accepted the theory after the concepts of seafloor spreading were later developed in 
                    the late 1950s and early 1960s.

                <p> The Moon, the Latin word is  Luna, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Although not the largest natural satellite in the Solar System, 
				among the satellites of major planets it is the largest relative to the size of the object it orbits. It is the second-densest satellite among 
				those whose densities are known.
                </p>
				<p>The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. Although there have been several hypotheses 
				for its origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact
				between Earth and a Mars-sized body.

                <p> The Moon is a differentiated body: it has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a 
				radius of 240 km and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 km. Around the core is a 
				partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 km. This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization 
				of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago. Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from 
				the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density 
				plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust on top. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with
				a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements. Consistent with this, geochemical mapping from orbit shows the crust is mostly anorthosite, and moon rock 
				samples of the flood lavas erupted on the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron rich than that of Earth. 
				Geophysical techniques suggest that the crust is on average circa 50 km thick.
