                    Neptune is named after the Roman sea god, for its main composition of hydrogen.
                    It, unfortunately is the last of the hydrogen and helium gas giants in our
                    solar system, and is the farthest planet from the Sun, thus also the coldest. Neptune
                    is the most dense of the gas planets. Its mass is 17 times the mass of Earth. 
                    Due to its distance from the Sun, Neptune has the longest revolution time of all the 
                    eight planets, that being 165 Earth years.

                <p> 
                    First observed by Voyager 2 in 1989, Neptune's Great Dark Spots
                    are actually anticyclonic storms. These storms are like Jupiter's
                    Great Red Spots, they however, are shorter and have cloud free interior.
                    The first spot captured by Voyager 2, was about the same size of Earth, 
                    having initial dimensions of 13,000 × 6,600 km, or 8,100 × 4,100 mi.

                    Neptune is a sister ice giant to Uranus. 
                    Neptune is mostly made of a very thick, 
                    very hot combination of water (H2O), ammonia 
                    (NH3), and methane (CH4) over a possible heavier,
                    approximately Earth-sized, solid core.

                    Neptune has 13 known moons, those being Triton, 
                    Nereid, Naiad, Larissa, Proteus, Galatea, Despina,
                    Thalassa, Neso, Halimede, Psamathe, Laomedeia, Sao.
                    Neptune's moons are named after various sea gods and
                    nymphs in Greek mythology. Triton is the most odd of 
                    all known moons, this is due to its retrograde orbit;
                    which makes it travel a direction opposite Neptune's rotation.
                    Scientists are yet to discover what causes this.

                    Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. 
                    This is mainly because of the distance between Neptune and Earth.
                    Voyager 2 made several discoveries at Neptune, including the Great Dark Spot.
                    Rovers are not viable for surface exploration for the fact that Neptune's entire
                    surface is very hot liquid.
