                <p> The discovery images were taken in 2011 and common proper motion was confirmed in 2012 as part of the Strategic Exploration of 
				Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS) survey. The SEEDS survey aims to detect and characterize giant planets and circumstellar 
				disks using the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope. In February 2013 Kuzuhara et al. submitted the discovery paper to The Astrophysical Journal, 
				and in August it was published. A follow-up study published in the October 2013 edition of the Astrophysical Journal confirmed methane
				absorption in the infrared H band, the first time this has been done for a directly imaged planet that formed within a disk.

                <p> 59 Virginis is a G-type main-sequence star located in the constellation Virgo. Discovered around 1538, the star can be seen with the 
				naked eye in most places around Earth. Since the star goes by many names (59 Virginis, e Virginis, HR 5011, etc) we’ll be referring to it as GJ 504.

				<p>In 2011-2012 the SEEDS survey, using the Suburu Telescope in Hawaii, turned its eye on the GJ 504 system. The SEEDS (‘Strategic Exploration of Exoplanets and Disk’) 
				survey, which uses the Suburu 8.2 meter telescope to directly image extrasolar stars, extrasolar planets, and planetary disks,  soon discovered a peculiar planet around the G-type star.
