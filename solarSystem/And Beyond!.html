                <p>GJ 504 b is a recently announced Jovian planet that rests around 57 light years away from Earth around 
				the yellow dwarf star 59 Virginis. It was picked up by the 8.2-metre Hawaiian Subaru Telescope that operates in the infrared wavebands.

                <p>GJ 504 b's spectral type was originally projected to be late T or early Y, but a follow-up study 
				estimated that a T8 spectral type was the best fit. The angular separation of the planet from its parent 
				star is about 2.5 arcseconds, corresponding to a projected separation of 43.5 AU, which is nearly nine times 
				the distance between Jupiter and the Sun, which poses a challenge to theoretical ideas of how giant planets form. 
				This planet is seen as an excellent target for detailed spectroscopic characterization due to its proximity to Earth 
				and its wide separation.</p>

                <p> The discovery images were taken in 2011 and common proper motion was confirmed in 2012 as part of the Strategic Exploration of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS) survey. The SEEDS survey aims to detect and characterize giant planets and circumstellar disks using the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope. In February 2013 Kuzuhara et al. submitted the discovery paper to The Astrophysical Journal, and in August it was published. A follow-up study published in the October 2013 edition of the Astrophysical Journal confirmed methane absorption in the infrared H band, the first time this has been done for a directly imaged planet that formed within a disk.
