                <p> Sol, the latin name for our Sun, is a gigantic ball of Hydrogen and Helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is the key ingredient to the creation of life as we know it.
                    This is because of the fact that an astronomical amount of energy is released from our Sun, and spread out throughout our Solar System on Solar Wind, the massive amounts of radiation and magnetism that push and steer the released enegry of the Sun.
                    This vast amount of energy from the Sun is created by means of Nuclear Fusion, which is the combining of The Sun's Helium and Hydrogen particles.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    Currently, our Sun is only halfway through it's life cycle, at an age of 4.567 billion years old*. Forming into a ball of gas from the collapse of a nearby molecular cloud, after a period of time the Hydrogen and Helium started to undergo thermonuclear fusion,
                    thus, became what we see now*. While our Sun is still stable, this might not be the case over the next portion of it's lifetime. Our Sun is a yellow dwarf star, and is heading on the path to becoming a red gint star. As the nuclear fusion processes of the Sun
                    slow down, the Sun will increase in size and temperature. This increase in size, is estimated to become large enough to engulf the inner-most planets in our Solar System, from Mercury to Mars, and possibly Earth. Fortuantely, this process will occur over the next
                    1 to 2 billion years*. With such a large timeframe, we should not have to worry about experiencing such an event.

                <p> Sol's is currently located in the Local Interstellar Cloud, which in turn is located in the Milky Way's Orion Arm*. The current mass of the Sun comes in at a grand total of 1,988,500 x 10 to the 30th KG*. That equals around 333,000 Earths in equivalent size.
                    The surface area of the Sun is 6.0877 x 10 to the 12th km squared, and the effective surfce temperature of the Sun is 5504 Â°C*. This temperature is 55 times hotter than the boiling point of water.

                <p> The picture shown on the left is an image of a solar flare erupting off of the surface of the Sun. The second picture, taken milliseconds later, shows the second part of the solar flare.
                    Solar flares occur when a build up of energy occurs on the surface of the Sun, resulting in an explosion of up to 160,000,000,000 megatons of TNT*, or 6,400,000,000 hydrogen bombs.

                <p> The dark spots that sometimes can be seen on the sun are called Sun Spots. These Sun spots are caused my magnetic convergences on the surface of the Sun,
                    causing a cooler-than-normal temperature on the surface of the Sun*. This dark inner area is called an "Umbra", while the outer dark circle is called the "Penumbra".
                    Another fact to note is that these Sun spots often coincide with Solar Flares, the explosive energy buildups on the Sun's surface.

                     magnetic fields and mechanics of our Sun by examining the magnetic distortions around Sun Spots, the flow of enegry around the corona, the outer energy field, of the Sun, as well as examine plasma particles floating around the Sun*.
