                <p> Sol, the latin name for our Sun, is a gigantic ball of Hydrogen and Helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is the key ingredient to the creation of life as we know it.
                    This is because of the fact that an astronomical amount of energy is released from our Sun, and spread out throughout our Solar System on Solar Wind, the massive amounts of radiation and magnetism that push and steer the released enegry of the Sun.
                    This vast amount of energy from the Sun is created by means of Nuclear Fusion, which is the combining of The Sun's Helium and Hydrogen particles.

                    Currently, our Sun is only halfway through it's life cycle, at an age of 4.567 billion years old*. Forming into a ball of gas from the collapse of a nearby molecular cloud, after a period of time the Hydrogen and Helium started to undergo thermonuclear fusion,
                    thus, became what we see now*. While our Sun is still stable, this might not be the case over the next portion of it's lifetime. Our Sun is a yellow dwarf star, and is heading on the path to becoming a red gint star. As the nuclear fusion processes of the Sun
                    slow down, the Sun will increase in size and temperature. This increase in size, is estimated to become large enough to engulf the inner-most planets in our Solar System, from Mercury to Mars, and possibly Earth. Fortuantely, this process will occur over the next
                    1 to 2 billion years. With such a large timeframe, we should not have to worry about experiencing such an event.
