- Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and due to its proximity can only be seen during twilight.
- For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965
- it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun. Thirteen times a century Mercury
- can be observed from the Earth passing across the face of the Sun in a event called a transit, the next will occur
- on May 9th, 2016.

                <p> Named after the Roman delivery god, Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the sun. Due to its proximity, it is hardly seen except during twilight. 
                    Mercury, observed to move around its orbit in about 116 days, is much faster than any other planet at that, whence it gets its name; for every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun.
                    Thirteen times a century, Mercury can be observed from Earth; passing accross the surface of the Sun, this process is called "transit".

                    Only two spacecrafts are know to have visited Mercury; 
                    Mariner 10 flew by Mercury three times in 1974 and 1975 
                    and mapped just under half of the planet’s surface. On August 3rd 2004, 
                    the Messenger probe was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station,
                    the first spacecraft to visit since the mid 1970’s, is still in orbit.

                    Mercury is the second densest planet:<br>
                    Even though the planet is small, Mercury is very dense. 
                    Each cubic centimetre has a density of 5.4 grams, with only the Earth having a higher density. 
                    This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock.

                    Mercury has a molten core:<br> 
                    In recent years scientists from NASA have come to believe the solid iron core of Mercury could in fact
                     be molten. Normally the core of smaller planets cools rapidly, but after extensive research, the results
                     were not in line with those expected from a solid core. Scientists now believe the core to contain a lighter 
                    element such as sulphur, which would lower the melting temperature of the core material. It is estimated 
                    Mercury’s core makes up 42% of its volume, while the Earth’s core makes up 17%.
