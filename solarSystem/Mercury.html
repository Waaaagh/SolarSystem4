- For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965
- it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun. Thirteen times a century Mercury
- can be observed from the Earth passing across the face of the Sun in a event called a transit, the next will occur

                <p> Named after the Roman delivery god, Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the sun. Due to its proximity, it is hardly seen except during twilight. 
                    Mercury, observed to move around its orbit in about 116 days, is much faster than any other planet at that, whence it gets its name; for every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun.
                    Thirteen times a century, Mercury can be observed from Earth; passing accross the surface of the Sun, this process is called "transit".
