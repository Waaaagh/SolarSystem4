            <p> Space Craft, the ballistic medium that allows humans and their equipment to travel deep into space, have a long history of successful triumphs that paved the way toward humanities future, though the road is not always so calm. 
                To date, the majority of Space Craft have used the capabilities of rocket engines to reach outer space. Genius rocket scientists and talented physicists around the world have contributed to the development of these Space Craft, which has led Humanity to achieve some of it's most remarkable achievments.

                Technology used in Space Craft, starting with the launch of Sputnik in October 4 1957* to the current date, has changed dramatically. To get an accurate picture of this technological timeframe, we have to go back to World War II. The man pictured on the left is Wernher von Braun, a german scientist during the war.
                Mr. Braun created one of the first rockets, known as the V2. This rocket was used by the Nazi's to attack London, though Mr. Braun did not like this as he wanted his inventions to be used for space travel, and not war. After the fall of Nazi Germany in late 1945, Wernher von Braun surrendered to the United States and
                then went to work for the United States Army*.

                In July 1960, Wernher von Braun was assigned a job at the National Aeronautics and Space Administarion (or NASA)*. There he was promoted to Director, and with the help of NASA created the Saturn V rocket. This rocket would propel the first humans to land on the Moon. With Mr. Braun's rocket advancments laying the foundation
                for the next rocket engines that would preceed the Saturn V.
