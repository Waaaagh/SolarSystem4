                <p> Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun in the Sol System, is a frigid world named after the Roman god Mars: The God of War. Captivating humanities imagination, Mars holds several mysteries yet to be uncovered. Being the closest planet to Earth, Mars has a hybrid of a true foreign world, and similarities back on Earth.
                    Mars, having a surface temperature of between 35 °C and -90 °C, as well as a very light atmosphere (0.01% atm of Earth)*, make it an interesting planet due not having any environmental extremes such as other planets in our solar system.
                </p>
                <p> The surface of Mars is made up mostly of rock and pinkish/red dust, giving it the nickname "The Red Planet". Mars currently has no magnetic field, that bieng ssaid, there are several peices of evidence to indicate that it prevously had a magnetic field. 
                    Research dates this magnetic field to have been operational 4 billion years ago, and was ended when the tectonic plates on Mars stopped moving*. Without a magnetic field, Mars' atmosphere started to be torn away by the Sun's Solar Winds, and over the next 4 billion years, Mars' atmosphere is nearly non-existant.
                </p>
                <p> With a lack of atmosphere, the surface temperature and pressure on Mars began to fall. The days got warmer, and the nights colder. The temperature transformed the planet into a massive desert, while sand storms became common, with some even engulfing the entire planet.

                <p> Before the end of Mars' magentic sphere, the Red Planet would have not looked so red. In fact, there is enough evidence to show that there could have been flowing water on Mars, as noted by the remains of possible canals and materials left behind when water evaporates. There is in fact water on Mars, though it is trapped away 
                    in solid chunks of ice at the North and South Poles of Mars. These sheets of ice are frozen water, though thawing them out would instantly evaporate the water due to the lack of Martian atmosphere. During the day, when the sun shines directly on the Polar Ice caps, th solid ice transform quickly into gas, and causes arupt winds 
                    to flow down the poles and cause high winds*. This would also cause tempertures around the poles to cool down significantly, causing seasonal frost to form on the ground.

                <p> Olympus Mons is the largest mountain on Mars. and the second largest mountain in our Solar System*. From Mons' loweest point, it is 25 KM high, which is nearly three times the height of Earth's Mount Everest. Olympus Mons is a shield volcano, being aused by thousands of years worth of magma overflow erupting from Mars' mantle.
                </p>
                <p> The hole on the top of olympus Mons is called a caldera, which forms when the lava that gushes out of the top of a volcano, stops flowing and recedes back into the volcano, in whihc it slowly cools down and forms a hole. Olympus Mons in estimated to have six of these caldera's overlaping at the top*.

                <p> An interesting possibility is that there was once liquid water on Mars. As the image on the left describes, there are several images taken by satellites that show ancient deltas and lakes that show that they once held water. Cross comparisons on these images and other images from Earth show numerous similarities,
                    further reinforcing this hypothesis. 
                </p>
                <p> As told above, there are frozen slabs of ice located on both poles of Mars, which proves that there was some circulation of water back when Mars had an atmosphere, leading to the eventual concentration of the left over water at either pole. As well, meteorites from mars have been exaimened and shown to have been
                    in contact with water before being cast out into space*.

                <p> Phobos is the largest and innermost moon of Mars. Named after the companion of the Greek god Ares, Phobos has a mass of 1.0659×10 to the 16th kg. It has an irreggular oval shpae to it due to not being large enough to have sufficient gravity to round itself out.
                </p>
                <p> The most unique characteristic of Phobos is the massive Stickney crater. An impact of sufficient size to create this crater would have shattered and severely lowered the size of what Phobos used to be.

Deimos is 0.56 times the size of Phobos, and shares the same non-circular shape as Phobos. Though unlike Phobos, Deimos' surface appears to be quite smooth.

                <p> Mars is currently the most investigated foreign planet due to Mars' proximity to Earth. Because of this, Mars has had numerous satellites orbit around it, and quite a few rovers landed on it compared to other celestial objects.
                </p>
                <p> The most notable rover to land on Mars is Curiosity (pictured Left), which landed on Mars on August 6, 2012. The first rover to successfully land on Mars was the Mars Pathfinder on 4 July, 1997.
